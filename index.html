        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>I’m a creative who loves making cool stuff in whatever form it takes. I draw, I animate, I sculpt, and I edit.. basically bringing ideas to life however they show up in my brain. I also design and build cosplay props, turning concepts into real, physical pieces. I like experimenting, mixing mediums, and turning random sparks of inspiration into something tangible. My skills are all over the place in the best way, and I use them to make work that feels alive, fun, and very me.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I’m from SMA Santa Theresia. During my time there, I learned a lot of things that helped me grow, like working with others, managing my time, and trying new creative ideas. The school really shaped how I think and helped me improve day by day.</p>

    <section id="experience" class="experience">
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I’ve taken on multiple art commissions from different clients. I started offering commissions on Discord and even though I didn’t stay active there for long, I still received orders from more than 10 customers. Now I do all my commissions through WhatsApp, which makes communication easier and more personal. I enjoy working with clients, understanding their ideas, and creating something they’re excited about.</p>
